                        in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections
                        ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
                        (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus

                        discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in
                        Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry
                        cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
                        diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                        don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                        disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
                        becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying
                        medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to
                        develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                        attention.</span></div>

                        spread?</b></div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                        People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to
                        person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with
                        COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other
                        people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose
                        or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19
                        who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3
                        feet) away from a person who is sick.
                        WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share
                        updated findings.
                        <hr>
                        <b>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</b>
                        <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through
                            contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How
                            does COVID-19 spread?”</p>
                        <hr>
                        <b>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</b>
                        <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is
                            coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.
                            However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true
                            at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone
                            who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing
                            research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated
                            findings.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <b>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</b>
                        <p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While
                            initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread
                            through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research
                            on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a
                            risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and
                            before eating.</p>

                        <b>Protection measures for everyone</b><br>
                        Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and
                        through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have
                        seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other
                        countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is
                        unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

                        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                        precautions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them
                                with soap and water.<br />Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                                alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
                            <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing
                                or sneezing.<br />Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets
                                from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe
                                in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
                            </li>
                            <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.<br />Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
                                viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth.
                                From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li>
                            <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means
                                covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                                Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br />Why? Droplets spread virus. By
                                following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such
                                as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
                            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                                medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health
                                authority.<br />Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health
                                care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect
                                you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
                            <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is
                                spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places &nbsp;&ndash; especially if
                                you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.<br />Why? You have a
                                higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li>

                            where COVID-19 is spreading</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone) </li>
                            <li>Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms
                                such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you
                                recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out,
                                e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.<br />Why? Avoiding
                                contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to
                                operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and
                                other viruses.</li>
                            <li>If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as
                                this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance
                                and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.<br />Why? Calling
                                in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                                health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other
                                viruses.</li>

                        <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19
                            outbreak unfolding there.</p>

                        <p>For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there
                            are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people
                            living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and
                            health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is
                            identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large
                            gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or
                            spreading COVID-19.</p>

                        <p>COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and
                            some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be
                            aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the
                            COVID-19 situation worldwide.</p>
